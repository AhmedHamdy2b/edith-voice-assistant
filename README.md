# edith-voice-assistant
A EDITH is a digital assistant that uses voice recognition, language processing algorithms, and voice synthesis to listen to specific voice commands and return relevant information or perform specific functions as requested by the user.  Based on specific commands, sometimes called intents, spoken by the user, EDITH can return relevant information by listening for specific keywords and filtering out the ambient noise.
